# Changelog

## [1.7.4] - 2025-09-10

### New Features
- **Custom application icon**: Application window now displays the custom Astro Dwarf Scheduler icon instead of the default feather icon in the title bar.

### Improvements
- **Enhanced camera type change validation**: When camera type is changed in settings tab, exposure and gain values are now validated against actual dropdown lists and automatically set to valid values that exist in the dropdown options.
- **Smart default value selection**: Improved camera type change handler to use intelligent fallback logic - if preferred default values don't exist in dropdown lists, automatically selects the first available valid option.
- **Dynamic dropdown synchronization**: Camera type changes now properly update both the field values AND the dropdown option lists simultaneously for consistent user experience.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed invalid dropdown values**: Resolved issue where camera type changes could set exposure and gain to values that don't exist in the device-specific dropdown lists.
- **Fixed dropdown option updates**: Camera type changes now properly refresh the exposure and gain dropdown options to match the selected device type.

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced value validation**: Added comprehensive validation to ensure exposure and gain values always correspond to valid dropdown options for each device type.
- **Improved error handling**: Added graceful fallback for icon loading with proper exception handling to prevent application crashes if icon file is missing.

## [1.7.3] - 2025-09-07

### New Features
- **Config-specific settings management**: Each device configuration now maintains separate INI files (config.ini, config_Test.ini, etc.) with independent settings for each device type.
- **Enhanced exposure and gain controls**: Settings tab now uses device-specific dropdown menus matching Create Session tab restrictions, preventing invalid value selection.
- **Device-type aware restrictions**: Exposure and gain options automatically update based on selected device type (Dwarf II, Dwarf 3 Tele Lens, Dwarf 3 Wide Lens).

### Improvements
- **Optimized settings synchronization**: Create Session tab defaults now update only when relevant settings actually change, improving performance and user experience.
- **Enhanced IR Cut filter management**: Filter options dynamically update based on device type selection with proper value mapping.
- **Improved initialization order**: Fixed tab initialization sequence to ensure all tabs are properly populated on application startup.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed empty tabs on startup**: Resolved issue where Sessions Overview, Results Session, Create Session, and Edit Sessions tabs appeared empty until settings were modified.
- **Fixed settings tab dropdown population**: Exposure and gain dropdowns now properly populate with device-appropriate values on initial load.
- **Fixed config file pollution**: Prevented dropdown references from being saved to configuration files, maintaining clean INI file structure.

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced callback system**: Implemented targeted update mechanisms for cross-tab communication with proper change detection.
- **Improved dropdown value management**: Added automatic population of device-specific exposure/gain values with proper fallback handling.
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced tab initialization with robust error handling and graceful degradation.

## [1.7.2] - 2025-09-03

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed GUI widget destruction errors**: Resolved "bad window path name" errors in session_info_label by adding robust widget existence checking and graceful error handling.
- **Fixed tab change event errors**: Resolved "expected integer but got" errors in tab navigation by improving tab index validation and type conversion handling.
- **Improved application stability**: Added comprehensive exception handling for Tkinter widget operations including AttributeError, TypeError, and IndexError in addition to TclError.

### Improvements
- **Enhanced widget lifecycle management**: GUI operations now fail gracefully without crashing the application when widgets are destroyed.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-08-31

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed dwarf_id inconsistency between Bluetooth and IP connections**: Device returns actual ID (2=Dwarf II, 3=Dwarf III) while config stores offset ID (1=Dwarf II, 2=Dwarf III). IP connection now properly converts actual device ID to offset before storing, ensuring consistent behavior across all connection methods.
- **Fixed config corruption on Bluetooth connection failure**: IP and ID values are no longer set to None when Bluetooth connection fails. Added proper null checks and validation to prevent config file corruption.
- **Improved Bluetooth connection error handling**: Enhanced error handling in `connect_ble_dwarf_win` and `connect_ble_dwarf` functions to only update config with valid values and prevent None values from being stored.

### Documentation
- **Updated README.md**: Added technical documentation about dwarf_id handling and configuration issues in the Troubleshooting section.
